You can combine tiles by placing 3 that have the same number next to each other. When you combine 3 tiles they will make a new tile with a bigger number on. The final goal is gain 7 as much as possible: the more numbers triplets(?) you make, bigger will be the gained score. No time limits. The new tile always moves to the space where the last tile in the group was placed. Bearing this in mind you can create combo chains if you place the tiles carefully.',

      'GAME_BENEFITS_DESCR' : 'Make 7 allows you to awake your mental energies and improve your logic skills, problem solving and concentration. In order to compose the 7 numbers, you will have to play in advance, planning your moves with cunning, to avoid getting unprepared by the next issue that the fate will reserve you! You will have to focus on the final goal to avoid filling every box without being able to compose the triplets and to figure out all the possible scenarios that may arise. Sometimes though, even the best strategy has to deal with the unpredictability: be ready to change your plans and be flexible during the game. Do not miss a bit of creativity: the easiest play is not always the best play',
